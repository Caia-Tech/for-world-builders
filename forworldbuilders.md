// Core Data model for world elements
@Model
class WorldElement {
    var id: UUID
    var worldID: UUID
    var type: ElementType
    var title: String
    var content: ElementContent
    var relationships: [Relationship]
    var tags: [String]
    var metadata: ElementMetadata
    
    init(worldID: UUID, type: ElementType, title: String) {
        self.id = UUID()
        self.worldID = worldID
        self.type = type
        self.title = title
        // ... initialize other properties
    }
}

// SwiftUI view for world overview
struct WorldOverviewView: View {
    @Environment(\.modelContext) private var context
    @Query private var elements: [WorldElement]
    @State private var searchText = ""
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            LazyVGrid(columns: gridColumns) {
                ForEach(filteredElements) { element in
                    ElementCardView(element: element)
                }
            }
            .searchable(text: $searchText)
            .navigationTitle("My World")
        }
    }
}
```

**Android Implementation**:
```kotlin
// Room database entity
@Entity(tableName = "world_elements")
data class WorldElementEntity(
    @PrimaryKey val id: String,
    val worldId: String,
    val type: String,
    val title: String,
    val content: String, // JSON serialized
    val relationships: String, // JSON serialized
    val tags: String, // JSON serialized
    val lastModified: Long
)

// Jetpack Compose UI
@Composable
fun WorldOverviewScreen(
    viewModel: WorldViewModel = hiltViewModel()
) {
    val worldState by viewModel.worldState.collectAsState()
    val elements by viewModel.elements.collectAsState()
    
    LazyVerticalGrid(
        columns = GridCells.Adaptive(160.dp)
    ) {
        items(elements) { element ->
            ElementCard(
                element = element,
                onClick = { viewModel.navigateToElement(element.id) }
            )
        }
    }
}
```

### Core Data Models

```typescript
// Shared data model interfaces (for documentation)
interface World {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  created: Date;
  lastModified: Date;
  settings: WorldSettings;
  statistics: WorldStatistics;
  version: number;
}

interface WorldElement {
  id: string;
  worldId: string;
  type: ElementType;

    private let model: MLModel
    
    func generateContent(
        prompt: String,
        worldContext: [WorldElement],
        maxTokens: Int = 500
    ) async -> String {
        // All processing happens on device
        let contextString = buildContext(from: worldContext)
        let input = ModelInput(prompt: prompt, context: contextString)
        
        let output = try await model.prediction(from: input)
        return output.generatedText
    }
    
    func searchWorldElements(
        query: String,
        elements: [WorldElement]
    ) -> [WorldElement] {
        // Local semantic search using Core ML embeddings
        return elements.filter { element in
            calculateSimilarity(query, element.content) > 0.7
        }
    }
}
```

**Controlled Sharing Mode**:
```kotlin
// Android selective data sharing
class ControlledSharingService {
    suspend fun generateWithSelectedData(
        prompt: String,
        worldId: String
    ): AIResponse {
        // Show data selection dialog
        val selectedElements = showElementSelectionDialog(worldId)
        
        if (selectedElements.isEmpty()) {
            // Fall back to local AI
            return localAIService.generate(prompt)
        }
        
        // Send only selected data to cloud AI
        return cloudAIService.generate(
            prompt = prompt,
            context = selectedElements.toJson(),
            userConsent = UserConsent.EXPLICIT
        )
    }
}
```

### Function Calling Implementation

**Local AI Function Calling**:
```swift
class LocalWorldTools {
    func getAvailableTools() -> [LocalAITool] {
        return [
            LocalAITool(
                name: "search_elements",
                description: "Search world elements by query",
                implementation: { args in
                    let query = args["query"] as? String ?? ""
                    let worldId = args["worldId"] as? String ?? ""
                    return self.searchElements(query: query, worldId: worldId)
                }
            ),
            LocalAITool(
                name: "analyze_relationships",
                description: "Analyze character relationships and connections",
                implementation: { args in
                    let elementId = args["elementId"] as? String ?? ""
                    return self.analyzeRelationships(elementId: elementId)
                }
            ),
            LocalAITool(
                name: "suggest_connections",
                description: "Suggest logical plot connections",
                implementation: { args in
                    let worldId = args["worldId"] as? String ?? ""
                    return self.generateConnectionSuggestions(worldId: worldId)
                }
            )
        ]
    }
}
```

### Example AI Conversations

**Local AI Conversation (Maximum Privacy)**:
```
User: "Analyze the political tensions in my fantasy kingdom"

Local AI: "I found 3 major political factions in your world:

🏰 **The Crown Loyalists** (led by Elena Brightwater)
- Control the military and royal guard
- Support traditional monarchy
- Oppose merchant guild influence

⚖️ **The Merchant Coalition** (led by House Blackwater)  
- Control trade routes and economy
- Want reduced noble taxation
- Secretly funding rebel movements

🗡️ **The Old Guard** (traditional nobles)
- Losing influence to merchants
- Desperate to maintain ancestral privileges
- May ally with crown if threatened

**Potential Conflicts:**
- Merchant tax rebellion could force crown/noble alliance
- Elena's magical abilities tip military balance
- Economic pressure points in trade route control

Would you like me to develop specific scenarios for any of these tensions?"
```

## Data Storage & Sync

### Platform-Specific Storage

**iOS/macOS - Core Data + CloudKit**:
```swift
// Automatic CloudKit sync setup
import CloudKit
import CoreData

class CoreDataStack {
    lazy var persistentContainer: NSPersistentCloudKitContainer = {
        let container = NSPersistentCloudKitContainer(name: "WorldBuilding")
        
        // Configure CloudKit sync
        let storeDescription = container.persistentStoreDescriptions.first!
        storeDescription.setOption(true as NSNumber, forKey: NSPersistentHistoryTrackingKey)
        storeDescription.setOption(true as NSNumber, forKey: NSPersistentStoreRemoteChangeNotificationPostOptionKey)
        
        container.loadPersistentStores { _, error in
            if let error = error {
                fatalError("Core Data error: \(error)")
            }
        }
        
        return container
    }()
}
```

**Android - Room Database**:
```kotlin
@Database(
    entities = [
        WorldEntity::class,
        ElementEntity::class,
        RelationshipEntity::class
    ],
    version = 1,
    exportSchema = false
)
@TypeConverters(Converters::class)
abstract class WorldDatabase : RoomDatabase() {
    abstract fun worldDao(): WorldDao
    abstract fun elementDao(): ElementDao
    abstract fun relationshipDao(): RelationshipDao
    
    companion object {
        @Volatile
        private var INSTANCE: WorldDatabase? = null
        
        fun getDatabase(context: Context): WorldDatabase {
            return INSTANCE ?: synchronized(this) {
                val instance = Room.databaseBuilder(
                    context.applicationContext,
                    WorldDatabase::class.java,
                    "world_database"
                ).addMigrations(MIGRATION_1_2).build()
                INSTANCE = instance
                instance
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Cloud Sync Strategy

**iOS Automatic Sync** (Zero Configuration):
- CloudKit handles sync automatically
- Conflict resolution built into Core Data
- Works across all Apple devices seamlessly
- User never needs to think about sync

**Android Manual Sync** (User Controlled):
```kotlin
class GoogleDriveSyncService {
    suspend fun syncWorld(world: World): SyncResult {
        try {
            val remoteFile = googleDriveClient.getFile("${world.id}.json")
            val localTimestamp = world.lastModified
            
            return when {
                remoteFile == null -> {
                    // Upload new world
                    uploadWorldToGoogleDrive(world)
                    SyncResult.Uploaded
                }
                remoteFile.modifiedTime > localTimestamp -> {
                    // Download and merge remote changes
                    val remoteWorld = downloadWorldFromGoogleDrive(world.id)
                    val mergedWorld = mergeWorlds(world, remoteWorld)
                    worldRepository.saveWorld(mergedWorld)
                    SyncResult.Downloaded
                }
                localTimestamp > remoteFile.modifiedTime -> {
                    // Upload local changes
                    uploadWorldToGoogleDrive(world)
                    SyncResult.Uploaded
                }
                else -> SyncResult.InSync
            }
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            return SyncResult.Error(e)
        }
    }
}
```

```swift
// iOS secure storage implementation
import CryptoKit

class SecureDataManager {
    private let keychain = Keychain(service: "com.caiatech.forworldbuilders")
    
    func encrypt(data: Data) throws -> EncryptedData {
        let key = SymmetricKey(size: .bits256)
        let sealedBox = try AES.GCM.seal(data, using: key)
        
        // Store key securely in Keychain
        try keychain.set(key.rawRepresentation, key: "encryption-key")
        
        return EncryptedData(
            encryptedData: sealedBox.ciphertext,
            nonce: sealedBox.nonce,
            tag: sealedBox.tag
        )
    }
}
```

**API Key Management**:
```kotlin
// Android secure API key storage
class APIKeyManager(private val context: Context) {
    private val masterKeyAlias = MasterKeys.getOrCreate(MasterKeys.AES256_GCM_SPEC)
    
    private val sharedPreferences = EncryptedSharedPreferences.create(
        "api_keys",
        masterKeyAlias,
        context,
        EncryptedSharedPreferences.PrefKeyEncryptionScheme.AES256_SIV,
        EncryptedSharedPreferences.PrefValueEncryptionScheme.AES256_GCM
    )
    
    fun storeAPIKey(provider: AIProvider, key: String) {
        sharedPreferences.edit()
            .putString("${provider.name}_api_key", key)
            .apply()
    }
    
    fun getAPIKey(provider: AIProvider): String? {
        return sharedPreferences.getString("${provider.name}_api_key", null)
    }
}
```

### AI Model Integration

**iOS Core ML Implementation**:
```swift
import CoreML

class LocalAIManager {
    private var tinyLlamaModel: MLModel?
    private var phi3Model: MLModel?
    
    func loadModels() async {
        // Load bundled TinyLlama model
        tinyLlamaModel = try? await MLModel.load(contentsOf: Bundle.main.url(forResource: "TinyLlama", withExtension: "mlpackage")!)
        
        // Load optional Phi-3 model if downloaded
        if let phi3URL = getDownloadedModelURL("Phi3Mini") {
            phi3Model = try? await MLModel.load(contentsOf: phi3URL)
        }
    }
    
    func generateText(prompt: String, useAdvancedModel: Bool = false) async -> String {
        let model = (useAdvancedModel && phi3Model != nil) ? phi3Model : tinyLlamaModel
        
        guard let model = model else {
            return "AI model not available"
        }
        
        let input = try? MLDictionaryFeatureProvider(dictionary: ["prompt": prompt])
        let output = try? await model.prediction(from: input!)
        
        return output?.featureValue(for: "generated_text")?.stringValue ?? "Generation failed"
    }
}
```

### Performance Optimization

**Database Optimization**:
```sql
-- Essential indexes for fast queries
CREATE INDEX idx_elements_world_type ON world_elements(world_id, type);
CREATE INDEX idx_elements_search ON world_elements_fts(title, content);
CREATE INDEX idx_relationships_source ON relationships(source_element_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_elements_modified ON world_elements(last_modified DESC);

-- Compound indexes for common query patterns
CREATE INDEX idx_elements_world_search ON world_elements(world_id, last_modified DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_relationships_strength ON relationships(source_element_id, strength DESC);
```

**Memory Management**:
```swift
// iOS efficient data loading
class EfficientDataManager {
    private let cache = NSCache<NSString, WorldElement>()
    
    func loadElement(id: String) async -> WorldElement? {
        // Check cache first
        if let cached = cache.object(forKey: id as NSString) {
            return cached
        }
        
        // Load from Core Data
        let element = await coreDataManager.fetchElement(id: id)
        
        // Cache for future use
        if let element = element {
            cache.setObject(element, forKey: id as NSString)
        }
        
        return element
    }
}
```
